<h2>Introduction to Tron Staking</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Tron Staking</strong> is a decentralized, user-friendly process that enables holders of TRX tokens to earn passive income by participating in the Tron network's consensus and governance. By locking up (staking) your TRX, you contribute to network security and decentralization while receiving regular staking rewards. As a core mechanism in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DeFi</a> ecosystem, Tron staking offers both accessibility and robust returns for retail and institutional investors.
</p>

<h2>What is Tron Staking?</h2>
<p>
  Tron Staking allows users to delegate or "freeze" their TRX tokens to support Super Representatives (SRs), who validate transactions and produce blocks. In return, stakers receive rewards in TRX and sometimes other tokens. The process is fully non-custodial, meaning you always retain ownership of your tokens, which are secured on-chain through audited smart contracts.

<ul>
  <li>Non-custodial staking directly from your own wallet</li>
  <li>Daily rewards paid out in TRX</li>
  <li>Support for top wallets, including Trust Wallet</li>
  <li>Active community governance via voting for Super Representatives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Tron Staking Stands Out</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Stake from popular wallets and dApps, including Trust Wallet</li>
  <li><strong>Low Entry Barrier:</strong> No minimum staking amount required</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> Tokens remain in your wallet, protected by on-chain smart contracts</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Real-time reward tracking and SR performance analytics</li>
</ul>
